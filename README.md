### Genesis : Required on your computer

In order to launch this project properly you will need to install :
-python 
-django
-axios
-nodeJS

### Genesis : School project

As a school project, we had to create a website with a database and an api.

the purpose of this project is to find animes using a searchbar, and then being able to put them in the favorites

Enjoy seeking the code !

### Technology

For this project, we had to use various tools. Here are those we used :
#### HTML5

Our HTML file is a fundamental here because it's like the body of our project. It allows us to define a skeleton for our website, to declare the numerous elements inside of it.  

#### CSS3

our stylesheets are really useful since they allow us to style every single element that we declared earlier. If the html file is our skeleton, this stylesheet is its skin.

#### Font Awesome

Now, this skin must be enriched with some original visuals such as beautiful icons, and Font Awesome is really great at this job because it delivers almost endless possibilities for our icons, even more if you own the pro version. (but for this project this is not my case)   

#### Javascript

Javascript is allowing us to add a lot of dynamism to our elements to enhance the global project. A lot of the elements of our pages are now triggering functions reorganizing elements and sharing informations with our database.

#### Django

Our database was made with Django, a python framework. This is the "memory" of our project, it allows us to store informations such as the id and passwords of our users, aswell as their favorite animes 

#### Anilist API

this api is the main content of our website. It allows us to collect the titles and the images of the animes we search.

### Global Structure : Designing our website

We decided to make our project a 3-Tier architecture which makes the website communicate with an api and a database.

Our website first communicates with the api to collect data about animes, which is graphically showed to the users of our site.
Then, they can select their favorites which are stored in our database (as well as their login)

### What did we learn ?

This project gave us the opportunity to enhance the knowledge we already had in these different sectors appart, but also to work in group (which is not an easy task when we have no global organization). Moreover, it helped us understand better the concepts of architecture behind bigger project.
